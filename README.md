# Roman Numeral Converter
This program is a Python script that takes a decimal number between 1 and 3999 from the user and converts it to its equivalent Roman numeral. It uses a simple algorithm to map each decimal value to its corresponding Roman numeral symbol, then iterates through the mapping to build the complete Roman numeral string. The program also includes input validation to ensure that the user enters a valid decimal number, and uses a primary main() function to organize the logic and error handling.

This script is designed to be run in a Python 3.11 environment, and follows the Python guidelines for good coding style and writing, including PEP 8 conventions for naming variables and functions, and PEP 257 conventions for docstrings. The script can be used as a standalone program, or can be integrated into a larger Python project as needed.

## Usage
To use the Roman Numeral Converter, simply run the script in a Python 3.11 environment and follow the prompts to enter a decimal number to convert. The program will validate the input and print the equivalent Roman numeral, or display an error message if the input is invalid.
